; About:
; I decided to make Common Lisp the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-CommonLisp) as Common Lisp is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Common Lisp programming language. It only makes sense to Common Lisp the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
